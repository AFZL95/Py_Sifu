# Py_Sifu

You maybe wonder what the heck is the repo title means and such a dope title I choose.
but I refer you to this quote in Wikipedia :
> Sifu or shīfu (from Mandarin spelling) is a title for and role of a skillful person or a master.
>  It may be written with the Chinese characters 師傅 (traditional)/师傅 (simplified) or 師父/师父. The character 師/师 means "skilled person", while the meaning of 傅 is "tutor" and the meaning of 父 is "father".

so I hope these examples can help amateur coding lovers to gain more skill in Python 3 programming language ;)
