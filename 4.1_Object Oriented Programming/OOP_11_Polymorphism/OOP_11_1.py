# we got an integer , a string and a tuple here

# in this particular example,
# the polymorphic behavior of the objects is
# implemented using inheritance all Python
# objects inherit from a base class called "object"
# which defines an underscore underscore str method
# so polymorphism allows the print function to accept
# arguments of any type and it's able to then print

a = 3
b = "tim"
c = 1, 2, 3

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
